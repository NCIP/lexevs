################# Configuration File General Documentation

# This is the configuration file for LexGrid based applications.  Each 
# option in this file is described just before the option.  Any line that 
# starts with a '#' sign is treated as a comment, and is completely ignored 
# by the application.  Due to the way that this file is processed - whenever
# you want to create a '\' character, you need to use two '\'.   For example
# the following paths are valid:
# C:\\temp\\foo\\
# C:/temp/foo/
#
# This path is _NOT_ valid.
# C:\temp\foo


################ Locating the config file at runtime

# The LexGrid system attempts to automatically locate this file in one of two ways:
#
# OPTION 1 - AutoSearch
# It determines the folder that the LexGrid classes are located (either in 
# a jar file, or a folder containing class files).  For this example, lets assume
# that the jar file containing LexGrid was found at 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\lib\lbRuntime.jar'
# Then the path it starts with will be 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\lib\'.  Lets call this 
# location 'A'.  Starting from location A, it checks for the following sub-path: 
# 'resources\config\config.props'.  Lets call this path 'B'.  If a file exists 
# 'A\B', the search is over.  If this file is not found - it goes up one directory
# from A, and checks for B again.  So, now it is checking "A\..\B". - which is
# 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props'.  This process continues until 
# it finds the file, reaches the root of the file system, or it has gone up 10 levels.
# At that point, it quits and and the startup fails.
#
# OPTION 2 - System Variable
# You may skip the auto search by setting the System Config variable 'LG_CONFIG_FILE'
# to the full absolute path of the config.props file.  
# Example - if you were starting from the command line, you would add this parameter to 
# the java command to set the 'System Property' 
# -DLG_CONFIG_FILE="C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props"

############# Additional Path Configuration

# The LG_BASE_PATH variable is the location that will be used beginning for resolving 
# any relative paths in this configuration file.  
#
# This variable is optional, and should usually be left blank.
#
# If you do not set this variable it will automatically be set to the location of the
# folder that contains your config.props file - this file - when the system starts up.  
# So all of your other relative paths should be set relative to the folder that contains
# your config.props file.  This is the recommended deployment configuration.
#
# Alternatively, you can enter an absolute path here, or you can also set this variable 
# by setting the 'System Property' 'LG_BASE_PATH'.  If you set the System Property variable
# this overrides any value here. 
LG_BASE_PATH=

# The location of the folder that contains your SQL drivers and extensions.  This folder and 
# its subfolders will be scanned for .jar files to add to the classpath.
#
# This folder must also contain either the lbRuntime.jar file, or the lgUtility.jar file (from
# the runtime-components folder)
#
# This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH or absolute.
# You may put more than one folder here by seperating the folders with a ';'.
JAR_FILE_LOCATION=../../runtime

# The location of the file that will store information about
# all loaded terminologies.  
# This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH or absolute.
REGISTRY_FILE=registry.xml

# The folder that will hold all of the generated system indexes.  
# This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH or absolute.
INDEX_LOCATION=../lbIndex

# amount of characters.
#
# NOTE: This value MUST BE UNIQUE for each LexBIG runtime
# that utilizes the same database host.
# NOTE: Do not use dashes '-' in the db_prefix value.
